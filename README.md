## Acknowledgments

book_ease was inspired by using [spacefm](https://ignorantguru.github.io/spacefm/) filemanager's bookmark/scripting interface to control [mplayer](http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/news.html) resulting a more feature complete audiobook reader than other options currently available for Linux.
