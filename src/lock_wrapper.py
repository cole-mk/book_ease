        """
        Acquire a lock, blocking or non-blocking.
        When invoked with the blocking argument set to True (the default), block until the
        lock is unlocked, then set it to locked and return True.

        When invoked with the blocking argument set to False, do not block.
        If a call with blocking set to True would block,
        return False immediately; otherwise, set the lock to locked and return True.

        When invoked with the floating-point timeout argument set to a positive value,
        block for at most the number of seconds specified by timeout and as long as the lock
        cannot be acquired. A timeout argument of -1 specifies an unbounded wait. It is
        forbidden to specify a timeout when blocking is False.

        The return value is True if the lock is acquired successfully,
        False if not (for example if the timeout expired).

        Changed in version 3.2: The timeout parameter is new.

        Changed in version 3.2: Lock acquisition can now be interrupted by signals on POSIX
        if the underlying threading implementation supports it.

        waiting for the lock to become unlocked, allow exactly one of them to proceed.
